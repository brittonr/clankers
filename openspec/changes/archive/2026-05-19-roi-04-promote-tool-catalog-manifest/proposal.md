# Promote tool catalog manifest

## Summary

Make embedded tool catalogs feel like product-owned manifests with deterministic validation, capability binding, and runtime-neutral exports.

## Motivation

Clankers already has green embedded SDK crates, adapter bricks, executable examples, capability packs, and release receipts. The next lego-like step needs scoped contracts that make product composition repeatable without collapsing functional-core / imperative-shell boundaries.

## Nickel and BLAKE3 placement

Use Nickel for authored tool-catalog contracts where schema, approval, redaction, runtime kind, and capability requirements are validated. Use BLAKE3 for exported manifest hashes, normalized metadata, and tool-denial/truncation fixtures.

## Non-goals

- Do not move daemon sockets, TUI, provider discovery, OAuth stores, Clankers DB/session ownership, Matrix, iroh/P2P, plugin supervision, or built-in tool bundles into generic SDK crates.
- Do not require live credentials, network access, daemon startup, or user-specific local state for acceptance evidence.
- Do not make generic SDK crates evaluate Nickel at runtime; Nickel is an authoring/export/check boundary unless a later change explicitly proves otherwise.
