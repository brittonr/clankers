## Why

Clankers has local memory and session search, but Hermes can plug in Honcho, OpenViking, Mem0, Hindsight, Holographic, RetainDB, ByteRover, and Supermemory. Clankers needs an abstraction that keeps privacy and prompt-boundary rules explicit.

## What Changes

- **External Memory Providers**: Add a provider interface for remote memory/personalization backends while preserving curated local memory.
- **User experience**: Provide a documented CLI/TUI flow and non-interactive mode suitable for daemon and scripted use.
- **Safety and policy**: Respect existing clankers sandboxing, provider credentials, session persistence, and project context boundaries.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `external-memory-providers`: Add a provider interface for remote memory/personalization backends while preserving curated local memory.

### Modified Capabilities
- `agent-tool-surface`: Agents can use this Hermes-parity feature without bespoke one-off code.
- `session-lifecycle`: Sessions record enough metadata for replay, audit, and troubleshooting.

## Impact

- **Files**: Likely touches `src/tools/`, `src/modes/`, `crates/clankers-agent/`, `crates/clankers-controller/`, `crates/clankers-config/`, docs, and tests.
- **APIs**: Adds or extends user-facing commands/tools/configuration; exact API is finalized during implementation.
- **Dependencies**: May add targeted crates or optional feature-gated integrations.
- **Testing**: Unit tests for parsing/policy, integration tests for session behavior, and docs/examples for the primary path.

## Scope

- **In scope**: A production-ready minimum slice with deterministic tests and documented limitations.
- **Out of scope**: Reimplementing every Hermes provider/backend on the first pass when a local or generic abstraction can land first.
